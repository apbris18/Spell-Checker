Installation:
1. Visit http://golang.org/dl.
2. Select "Download the Go Distribution".
3. Choose the version of Go you wish to download that can work on your current platform.
- For example, I used go1.6.4.windows-amd64 in order to be compatible with Windows.  There are other versions for OS, FreeBSD and Linux.
4. Go through the Installation Wizard to install Go successfully.
- It will automatically install Go in the C: directory, but you can change it to another location.
5. Check your environment variables by going to Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables.
6.  Make sure there is an environment variable added in PATH to go\bin.
7. Select OK out of Environment Variables.
8. Download a compatible text editor (this program was created on Atom https://atom.io/)
9. Install the "go-plus" package within the text editor.

Execution:
1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Change directory to the Spell Checker folder.
3. Type in "dir" to ensure the directory is all set.
4. Type in "go env" to review the current environment setup.
5. Type in "set GOPATH = " + filepath from C: to Spell Checker folder.
6. Type in "set GOBIN = " + filepath from C: to Spell Checker folder + /bin.
7. Type in "go run src/main/CP.go".
8. When prompted, type in the location of the text file you wish to review.
 - For best performance, have your text file located in src/main.
