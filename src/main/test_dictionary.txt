Not long after the NES was moved into my bedroom, I was flipping through the Super Mario Bros. 2
manual while my dad was immersed in the game.
If you're familiar with instruction manuals from the NES and SNES days, you'll know that it was
common for unique hand-drawn art to be littered
throughout the pages. It was that level of presentation that added value to those otherwise
 uninteresting instructions, and it's why you often
hear '80s kids bemoaning the near extinction of manuals in the current market. In the case of
Super Mario Bros. 2, it was the detailed
illustrations of the game's cast that captured my attention. They were so bizarre and charming, and
they provided me a better image of what
those blocky 8-bit characters actually looked like. Most importantly, these illustrations were much
easier to emulate than real-world subjects
were.
